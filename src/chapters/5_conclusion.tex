\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Language boundaries limit the analyses, making polyglot program optimization challenging.
        \vspace{2mm}
        \item Our research found HIR the most suitable for common interface.
        \vspace{2mm}
        \item We propose to use this HIR to develop an analysis framework for polyglot program optimization.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This inter-language framework aims to facilitate optimization techniques across language boundaries.
        \vspace{2mm}
        \item Developing a more comprehensive framework that integrates with existing GraalVM system.
        \vspace{2mm}
        \item Evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed framework with real-world applications.
    \end{itemize}
